# BulletTwitter

BulletTwitter functions on top of the python-twitter packaged. It implements data crawling tasks such as tweet hydration, search lookup and storage, and user timeline gathering.
Examples of how to run these types of tasks can be found in the driver program.

The system must be supplied with a tab seperated file of twitter api keys. An example file is provided.

Please adhere to the Twitter service Terms of Use when crawling data.
